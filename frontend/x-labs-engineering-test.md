# X-Lab Engineering Interview Challenge - Leeds Beer Quest

## The Challenge
The core data for this challenge is based on pubs around Leeds.
The raw data can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1o5JTtFUHcBAjH47z4i_eZrFdyXvSzY_S/view) 
and is based around the [Leeds Beer Quest](https://datamillnorth.org/dataset/leeds-beer-quest).
X-Lab would like to build an application using this data, that presents information 
about pubs in and around Leeds to their staff so that they can choose an appropriate 
post-work watering hole based on their location, rating and services offered.

### This challenge can be attempted in one of 3 ways, depending on core discipline.
#### Front end focussed:
- Use the API provided at [Leeds Beer Quest](https://datamillnorth.org/dataset/leeds-beer-quest) 
(this wraps the above dataset) to build a front end application to present this dataset 
in a searchable manner to end users
#### Back end focussed:
- Using the above dataset, build an API that can be used by front end applications.
#### Infrastructure focussed:
- Deliver a working infrastructure to house all components of the system. 
We will provide base containers on request, or you may use your own. 
Principal Engineers (and senior engineers looking for extra kudos) should attempt aspects 
of all three challenges in order to demonstrate breadth of knowledge across the disciplines.

## The Logistics
This challenge will be split into two parts:
1. An initial build to be done by the candidate in their own time 
a. You may spend as long as you like on this part of the challenge, although we expect an 
hour or two to be more than sufficient - we do not expect candidates to give up days of their time.
2. A pair programming exercise with an X-Lab engineer to build on the work undertaken in (1) as 
part of a technical interview, if selected to proceed.
a. This exercise will look to explain and clarify approach before undertaking an extension of 
it as a pair.
You may use the programming language and frameworks of your choice, unless given specific steer 
during initial conversations. You are free to use any tooling, libraries etc that you like and 
to deliver this in a typical manner - Google and SO are absolutely allowed.
The solution can include supporting documentation, diagrams or pseudo-code as you see fit to 
support any code produced. Please consider portability in your solution; this may be reviewed 
by someone running on a different OS/platform from you.
Given this is an open challenge, there is no expectation of receiving “complete” solutions - 
this is designed to understand approach to engineering and overall confidence in technology, 
not to produce a working production application.
The solution for part 1 should be submitted 2 days prior to part 2 to allow time for review 
before the pairing challenge, where possible. The preference for sharing this would be via 
GitHub, but any reasonable means is acceptable.


For clarifications, please email x-labsystems. We would also encourage candidates to feed back 
on the format of this challenge, and their experience with it, so that we can help improve it 
in the future.
